## Primary Objective - 3D Visualization


### Presenting the 3D Visualisation of the project To clients

---

#### Case Study Taysom
- Established this project as a 3D Visualization benchmark.
- We learned a lot from this project.
- Clients validated the 3D Visuals are exceptional
- Communicates visually how the client could use the space creating a desire and sense of purpose.


#### Lessons Learned
- Building a robust asset library is key to the success of the project.
- We should block out time for building the asset library.

**Level Of Detail**
- Found that a lower 'Smudgey' level of detail is better for the client.

---

## 3D Software
- SketchUp Selected due to Open Source nature.
- SketchUp is the industry entry level 3D Software anyone can use.

### Phase 01 | 3D Visualisation 
##### Circa 15 minutes

1. Objective       -->  Vale Style Beautiful 3D Visuals
2. State Problem   -->  We need to create a 3D Visualisation of the project that is styled in an appealing humanised art style.
3. State Solutions -->  Stable Diffusion, SketchUp, Vale Design Suite, Programmatic Framework creator

Benefits Of 3D Visualisation
- Communicating the design intent and the client's vision.
- Creating a desire and sense of purpose.
- Higher lead conversion rates.
- 

### Phase 02 | Programmatic Design
##### Circa 15 minutes

#### Programmatic Rooflight Generator
- Removed current concept drawing requirement.
  - Produces a Elevation Drawing.
  - Produces a 3D Visualisation.
  - Produces a Plan View.
- Automates the creation of quotation. 
- Quick to adjust and iterate.
- Eliminates costly CAD Engineer mistakes.

- 

### Phase 03 | Project Portal
##### Circa 15 minutes

#### Explanation of Project Portal
