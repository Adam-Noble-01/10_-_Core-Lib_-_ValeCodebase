# Vale Garden House: Crafting Bespoke Orangeries in Grantham

### Origins and Heritage

Vale Garden Houses, based in Grantham, Lincolnshire, is a distinguished family‑run company, established in 1983. Over the past four decades, it has earned an esteemed reputation for its design and manufacture of finely crafted timber orangeries, conservatories and rooflights ([houseandgarden.co.uk][1]). The company’s ethos reflects a harmonious fusion of traditional craftsmanship and modern innovations, cementing its position as a leader in bespoke glazed structures.

### Design Philosophy

Vale’s design approach is characterised by meticulous attention to detail. Each orangery is tailored to blend seamlessly with its host property, whether Georgian, Victorian, Edwardian or Arts & Crafts ([houseandgarden.co.uk][1]). Their team of designers ensures that structures not only harmonise with architectural heritage but also enhance the home’s functionality, focusing on considerations such as lighting, heating and daily usability ([houseandgarden.co.uk][1]).

### In‑House Craftsmanship

A standout feature of Vale’s operation is its vertically integrated production process. The company handles all phases internally—from hand‑carving decorative timber detailing to manufacturing double‑glazed units—rather than outsourcing ([houseandgarden.co.uk][1]). This in‑house control ensures consistent quality and allows for the highest level of customisation in every project.

### Innovation and Structural Performance

Vale Garden Houses embraces innovation in structural design and materials. Their roofs often combine metal and timber to deliver robust yet delicate glazing rafters ([countrylife.co.uk][2]). The firm’s structures are engineered to withstand snow loads, sub‑zero temperatures and even seismic activity, having undertaken international projects in mountainous regions and earthquake‑prone areas such as Japan ([countrylife.co.uk][2]).

### Full‑Service Project Delivery

Clients benefit from Vale’s comprehensive project management. The company assists with planning permission and listed building consents, collaborating seamlessly with architects, interior designers and builders ([houseandgarden.co.uk][1]). Additionally, they offer expert advice on lighting, underfloor heating, flooring materials and interior finishes—ensuring the orangery integrates well with existing interiors ([houzz.co.uk][3]).

Their expertise with listed and period properties makes them especially valued in heritage‑sensitive regions. Despite its rural roots, Vale’s work resonates far beyond Lincolnshire.

### Materiality and Aesthetic Harmony

Vale favours traditional materials—quality timber framing, stone or brick bases and lantern roofs—combined with contemporary insulation and double‑glazing . Their designs often feature hand‑crafted decorative profiles and roof‑lights that both mirror period styles and offer steel‑grade performance. This balance of aesthetic fidelity and performance defines their timeless aesthetic .

Their craftsmanship has also garnered multiple Houzz awards and badges, attesting to excellence in design, build quality and customer service .
