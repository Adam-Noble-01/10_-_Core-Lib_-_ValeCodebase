# SketchUp RubyScript Developer
# -------------------------------------
## ROLE    |  Highly Experienced RubyScript SketchUp Plugin Developer
## PROJECT |  Vale Design Suite; Specifically the Framework Tools Section of the plugin
## CONTEXT |  This tool will be used to configure the framework of a Vale Garden Houses Structure within the Vale Design Suite SketchUp Plugin.
## TASK    |  Carefully review the existing framework configurator scripts logic and handling.

- You are tasked with generating a **Complete, Self-contained Ruby Script** 
- for SketchUp (targeting SketchUp 2024 / 2025 APIs).
- This script should implement a simple configurable bench builder using a UI::HtmlDialog with full two-way real-time interactivity.
- Ensure you reference the existing bench script and adapt it for the window tool.
-This is a detailed specification for developing a new parametric 3D window component, modeled in reference to an existing working bench script.
-The design incorporates adjustable vertical and horizontal glaze bars to simulate multi-pane Georgian-style windows.
-Emphasis is placed on using visual sliders and typed input, separating this from the bench tool in both logic and dictionary.
-Geometry must adapt dynamically with constraints and maintain correct spatial logic for fitting glass panes and frame components.
  
**Existing Bench Script : `ATest01_-_BenchConfigurator.rb`**

**New Window Script     : `ATest01_-_WindowConfigurator.rb`**

WINDOW FRAME COMPONENTS

-Create a new product script for a window component, separate from the bench script.
-Component includes:

  -Left jamb positioned at X:0 Y:0 Z:0 acting as axis benchmark.
  -Right jamb offset along X-axis dynamically via configurator input.
  -Bottom rail and top rail components.
-All four frame sides (top, bottom, left, right) should have:

  -Depth of 50 mm along Y-axis.
  -Adjustable visual thickness along Z-axis (profile depth from front view) defaulting to 90 mm.
  -Thickness must be adjustable between 40 mm and 120 mm.

GLASS PANES

-A single 20 mm Y-depth glass pane is required by default.
-Glass positioning:

  -Positioned 15 mm from front face of window (Y-axis).
  -20 mm thickness in Y.
  -Remaining 15 mm space behind the glass (total 50 mm Y depth).

GLAZE BARS (GEORGIAN STYLE DIVIDERS)

-Input boxes required for:

  -Vertical glaze bars (min: 0, max: 8).
  -Horizontal glaze bars (min: 1, max: 8).
-Glaze bars should:

  -Be dynamically created based on input.
  -Divide the glass pane area into appropriately sized sub-panes.
  -Be 30 mm in thickness between panes.
  -Have dimensions:

    -20 mm along X.
    -50 mm along Y.
    -Z-dimension is parametric based on frame thickness.
-Glaze bars must fit between inner boundaries of the outer frame and be nested properly within.

INPUT & INTERFACE

-Incorporate sliders for both vertical and horizontal glaze bar counts.
-Sliders must restrict input to between 0–8 vertical and 1–8 horizontal.
-Allow numeric input override for precision.
-Ensure dynamic visual update of the component in real-time (as with the bench tool).

TEXTURES & VISUALS

-Apply a glass texture to glass panes.
-Reuse existing wood texturing from the bench tool but rename it to avoid conflict.
-Glass should render semi-transparent or fully transparent as per material logic.

LOGIC & INTEGRATION

-Create a new dictionary specifically for the window tool to ensure:

  -No UI conflicts with the bench tool.
  -Tool remains modular and separate in function.
-Do not rewrite existing logic that works from the bench tool; instead adapt and repurpose.
-Design must be capable of building a new JSON structure for window geometry.
-All spacing and scaling logic must ensure:

  -Glass panes fit cleanly between glaze bars.
  -Glaze bars adjust with number inputs.
  -All elements remain parametric and visually consistent.
